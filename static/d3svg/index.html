    <h2 class="text-center pt-6">Pain</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Relying on a 3rd party solution leaves you vulnerable</em>
    </p>
    <p>3rd party chart libraries can make for a great demo, but getting them to production is a different story.</p>
    <p>When you start a new project, you don&#39;t know
      <em>exactly</em> what you&#39;re going to build. You might have user stories, or wireframes, or even a detailed spec, but
      if you&#39;re doing it right, things will evolve. You&#39;ll discover the data doesn&#39;t support that view, or users
      would be happier with a different view of things, and changes will be made.</p>
    <p>Problem is, you don&#39;t know until it&#39;s too late that your library of choice doesn&#39;t support your latest requirement.</p>
    <p>Uncertainty is another word for stress.</p>
    <p>Does that off-the-shelf library give you the APIs and styles you need to implement the vision? Anybody&#39;s guess.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Customizability</em>
    </p>
    <p>Stop me if this sounds familiar. Your designer sends over revision #72, and they want to make some &quot;tweaks&quot;
      to the charts. Problem is, the tweaks they want aren&#39;t something the library exposes to you. &quot;Nobody would
      ever need to change
      <em>that</em>.&quot;</p>
    <p>Uh huh.</p>
    <p>Now you have some decisions to make. Do you tell your colleagues (or your boss?!) &quot;sorry folks, I picked a charting
      library that restricts what we can and cannot implement.&quot;? That doesn&#39;t sound very good for your career.</p>
    <p>At the same time, ripping out your chart library in favor of another one doesn&#39;t make sense either. Who&#39;s to
      say it&#39;s any better? What if it&#39;s worse?!</p>
    <p>Rock, meet hard place. Population: you.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Performance AXE?</em>
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-center pt-6">Dream</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Native web tech on every device</em>
    </p>
    <p>Wouldn&#39;t it be better if you knew how to target open web technology that is performant and ubiquitous? SVG has been
      a W3C spec since 1999! Not only does it perform well across devices, it&#39;s also boasts small file sizes and it compresses
      really well.</p>
    <p>
      <em>One function to ensure responsiveness</em>
    </p>
    <p>What if you could make every chart responsive using one small utility function? From a not-so-new smartphone to a massive
      5K monitor and everything in between, SVG graphics will stay crisp and clear if built correctly.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Performant by default with room to grow</em>
    </p>
    <p>Thanks to its maturity SVG is performant by default. Out of the box, you could use it to draw (and animate!) hundreds
      if not thousands of elements without issue.</p>
    <p>If you do manage to bump up against the limits of SVG, D3 enables you to easily target
      <code>canvas</code> elements instead by changing just a small fraction of your code.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Control over every pixel</em>
    </p>
    <p>With D3 and SVG, you use CSS to style things, just like with the rest of your code. You&#39;ve got direct, clean access
      to every stroke, fill, and dimension.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Build foundational knowledge</em>
    </p>
    <p>Data Visualization is a great use case for SVG but it&#39;s not the only one. SVG has become a popular replacement for
      icon fonts and simple images thanks to their versatility and resolution independence. Knowing how to work with SVG
      is a valuable skill to have in your toolbox, especially for developers tasked with building creative UIs and interactions.</p>
    <p>
      <em>The world is mobile. Your charts had better be, too. AXE?</em>

    <p>Testimonials</p>

    <h2 class="text-center pt-6">You can&#39;t learn D3 quicker than this (Overcome Objections)</h2>
    <p>These materials contain no magic. Every bit of information in them is freely available on the internet.</p>
    <p>But a lack of information is rarely the problem these days. The challenge is knowing which information is worth learning
      and what to ignore. </p>
    <p>Play up info density, concise, etc</p>

    <h3>Who is this for?</h3>
    This book assumes you know the basics of D3 but are not familiar with SVG. If
    <em>D3 in 5 Days</em> was your first exposure to D3 this book should be perfect for you. It assumes no knowledge of SVG,
    but it does assume you understand things like scales and selections.

    <h3>How is the book structured?</h3>
    This book is basically divided into 2 parts. The first 4 chapters cover the basics of SVG itself, and the last 6 chapters
        introduce D3 APIs and techniques for creating SVG charts programmatically.

    <ol>
      <li>SVG Elements</li>
      <li>Basic Shapes in SVG</li>
      <li>Working with Text in SVG</li>
      <li>SVG Groups and CSS Transforms</li>
      <li>Creating SVG with D3 APIs</li>
      <li>A Blueprint for Charts with Axes</li>
      <li>SVG Bubble Charts with D3</li>
      <li>SVG Line Charts with D3</li>
      <li>SVG Area Charts with D3</li>
      <li>Make Any SVG Responsive</li>
    </ol>

    The book is chock full of code examples, including several CodePen Pens. The book provides ample context and explanation
      for each one, but if you&#39;d like to explore them on your own they&#39;re
      <a href='https://codepen.io/collection/ee6b5121a5a3df356c72e11b80094c02/'>available as a collection here</a>.

      If you purchase a bundle, you also receive 26 video lessons, totaling more than 2.5 hours! Nine of those
      lessons directly correspond to the content in this book and are referenced in-place within the text. (These videos
      are also available to
      <a href='https://egghead.io/courses/build-interactive-javascript-charts-with-d3-v4'>Egghead PRO subscribers</a>.)
