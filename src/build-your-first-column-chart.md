Learning D3 can be intimidating, but it really doesn't have to be. Once you learn it's conventions and patterns and a handful of its APIs it's actually very approachable. In an attempt to convey that, I've put together a short guide that shows how to create a basic column chart.

It's not quite a cheat sheet, but it is concise and to the point, with some great links to more information should you need or want it.
