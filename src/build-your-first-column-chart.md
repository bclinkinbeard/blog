Learning D3 can be intimidating, but it really doesn't have to be. Once you learn it's conventions and patterns and a handful of its APIs it's actually very approachable. In an attempt to convey that, I've put together a short guide that shows how to create a basic column chart.

It's not quite a cheat sheet, but it is concise and to the point, with some great links to more information should you need or want it. If you want to **Build your first column chart with D3 v4** like the one below in under 10 minutes, toss your email address in the form below and I'll send it right over. Happy hacking!
