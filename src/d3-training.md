# D3 TRAINING SALES PAGE

Save Thousands of Dollars and Hundreds of Hours of Frustration for Your Team

Your team deserves the best training possible. Know Better brings practical real-world D3.js experience to your team with on-site training.


## Pain
You've mastered R, ETL, SPSS, SAS, and the other data science essentials but sharing your results feels... anti-climactic. Patterns, insights, and key findings are locked inside massive PDFs or worse: clunky Word documents. <span style="font-size: 2rem">üò±</span>

Your carefully crafted data pipeline has a cork in the end, and a change in the questions being asked means re-running processes, generating new assets, and lots of frustration.

If you're delivering walls of text with a few underwhelming images sprinkled in **you're devaluing your hard work**. It might not be fair, but _how_ information is presented is just as important as the information itself.

> "An algorithm must be seen to be believed"¬†- Donald Knuth

You know interactive, web-based visualizations are a better way to present your information, but how do you get from here to there?

- How do you prepare and load your data?
- How can the new format be integrated into your existing workflow?
- How do you make them engaging?
- How do you make them available to people?
- Should they work on phones and tablets?
- What are the "best practices"?
- How do you make sure your code performs well?
- How do you make your code reusable?

D3.js is the de facto industry standard when it comes to interactive data visualizations. It has [nearly 60,000 stars on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=stars:%3E1&amp;s=stars&amp;type=Repositories), making it one of the most popular open source projects on the planet, and powers compelling features for the NY Times, FiveThirtyEight, Twitter, NASA, Google, NBC, and Financial Times.

It's also notoriously hard to learn. üò≠

There are nearly [25,000 D3 questions on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/d3.js) so obviously, it's not the easiest skill to add to your toolbox. Sifting through all of the questions, the documentation, the blog posts, and the examples would take a long time. A **very** long time.

Time you don‚Äôt have.

## Dream
The web is now fully capable, and frankly ideal, for sharing data insights in ways that engage, excite, and inform stakeholders and users. Think about it: would you rather read a whitepaper or interact with a responsive, animated visualization in your browser that surfaces vital information in seconds?

We're not talking about pie charts and scatter plots. We're talking immersive simulations, instructive diagrams, and explorable explanations. And these aren't just eye candy, they produce measurable improvements in engagement and visibility. Monthly traffic to FiveThirtyEight grew from about 2.8 million¬†unique visitors¬†in April 2014 to [10.7 million unique visitors in January 2016](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/694974558831525888/photo/1).

Imagine the reaction of your audience when, instead of a document that resembles a dissertation, you deliver a link that leads them to an exciting, animated visualization of your insights.

Given all the time in the world, you could comb the internet, read a couple of books, watch [high-quality tutorial videos on egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/build-interactive-javascript-charts-with-d3-v4), and eventually gain the practical experience needed to build a solid project that leverages D3.js.

Unfortunately, time is finite and precious. You have deadlines and existing demands on your time, and you need a leg-up. You need mentoring and personalized instruction from a professional with proven experience teaching D3.js. You need someone to turn to when you inevitably become stuck on a new challenge.

## Fix
You can bring proven, personalized knowledge to your team based on real world experience. Know Better Training was created to level up teams like yours.

Skip the novice phase and let a software veteran with nearly two decades of experience jumpstart your team's skills to ensure your project begins on the right foot.

A 2-day Know Better workshop will teach your team:

- Basic D3.js prerequisites like HTML and CSS
- Fundamental D3.js concepts and APIs
- How to prepare your data for use with D3.js
- D3.js Best Practices
- How and when to reuse code
- How to integrate D3 into existing sites and applications

Give your team the tools and confidence to succeed.

The first day of your workshop will be spent covering the core concepts and functionality of D3. Your team will receive instruction, and then implement what they have learned in a hands-on fashion to ensure understanding.

The second day will be spent building a small application that combines multiple visualizations and/or integrates a visualization into your application.

### Customized to your needs

Every team has different needs. Prior to your workshop, we will work closely with you to tailor the curriculum to meet your needs. This includes the day 2 sample application. We want to use this time to create something genuine to your company's problems. While it will need to be small, using day 2 to build something a "little more real" will help to solidify the concepts your team learned on day 1.

After your workshop you'll have access to a private Slack team for 90 days for personalized Q&A. Ask questions, share code samples, and get feedback on the best way to implement the material you‚Äôve learned.
